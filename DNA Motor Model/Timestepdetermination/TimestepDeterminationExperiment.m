% The following is written to determine the lowest time significat time
% point. Note that the N simulate motor function has been altered to have
% timestep be a parameter than can be inputted 


ten = DetermineTimestep(10);


one = DetermineTimestep(1);
onetenth = DetermineTimestep(0.1);

onehundreth = DetermineTimestep(0.01);
onethousandth = DetermineTimestep(0.001);
